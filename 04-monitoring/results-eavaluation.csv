NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is non-relevant because it provides several pieces of unnecessary and unrelated information. It mentions being a course teaching assistant, discusses general advice on accessing the Zoomcamp ML Course materials, directs to an external link that doesn't specifically address FAQ questions about data engineering within the course context.",,
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not directly follow the intent and content of the RAG system's expected action, which is to provide a straightforward link or process for signing up. Instead, it veers off-topic by discussing general practices unrelated points without addressing any signup method within the context provided.",,
SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM NORMALSPIRIT OF THE ORIGINAL ANSWER,"The generated answer fails to directly address the purpose of creating and referencing a FAQ document for guidance. Instead, it veers into instructions about structuring questions effectively in an unrelated course setting ('Computer Science Specialization'), which diverges significantly from discussing how one might prepare or guide others specifically using provided 'Zoomcamp' resources like work paths and extra credit methods that relate to studying Machine Learning FAQs as denoted by the original answer. It also doesn't touch on timing details mentioned in the course, nor does it offer relevant information regarding when this specialized Zoomcamp ends.",,
,,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides specific instructions on how to sign up for the course, which directly addresses part of what is asked in the original question. However, it loses contextual information about past iterations and accessibility that may also be relevant when signing up or joining after a gap."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer delves into specifics regarding the GitHub repository link use in assignments and community contributions. While relevant to a broader data engineering context, it deviates from directly answering whether there is such a sign-up option as implied for enrolling or attending Machine Learning Zoomcamp.",,

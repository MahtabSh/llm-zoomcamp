       " {'answer_llm': 'To structure your questions and answers for this ML Zoomcamp Computer Science Specialization course effectively, consider creating a question-and-answer system that is friendly toward various levels of engagement with the material. You could ask about next steps by directing newcomers to first access materials through links provided on official channels or via specific documents associated with their cohort year. For example: \"New students start accessing course resources at [specific link], where you find all necessary modules and videos for a thorough understanding of our curriculum.\"\\n\\nYou could address the submission method by instructing learners to include social media links in designated sections but emphasize they should submit up to seven distinct URLs per homework form submissions, as this will proportionately affect their extra credit scores. For instance: \"Please use the appropriate field on our assessment forms when posting your findings and learning milestones by incorporating no more than 7 unique social media sharing links related to course content each week.\"\\n\\nIn regards to time estimation for successful completion, you might include a detailed breakdown of how much study is required per module or the entirety of participation in activities like projects, while offering data from peer observations. For example: \"Considering Aram\\'s comprehensive timing analysis where 10 hours per week equate roughly to mastery across content and assignments during this course schedule,\" ensure you present time management as a guide for structured learning outcomes within the given course period, mention the doubling of points system for extended projects like midterms or capstrokes: \"Engaging in extensive activities such as Midterm Capstone will see your efforts rewarded with twofold points due to their substantial contribution and complexity.\"\\n\\nLastly, inform about duration transparency so that learners are aware when the course concludes. As an example of structured questioning around this topic: \"This specialization has various activities designed across a ~4-month framework; however, expect additional learning projects which may extend participation beyond standard requirements.\"',\n",
